# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Property Listing Onboarding Flow is designed to ensure that only verified property owners can list properties on the DirectHome platform. This feature will implement a dashboard-centric approach with role-based navigation and verification processes, ensuring that only legitimate property owners can create listings while providing a more intuitive user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Role-Based Navigation in Header

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation options to adapt based on my authentication status, so that I can easily access the most relevant features for my current state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user visits the platform THEN the system SHALL display a "List Your Property" button in the header.
2. WHEN an authenticated user (any role) visits the platform THEN the system SHALL display a "Dashboard" button in the header instead of "List Your Property".
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user clicks the "List Your Property" button THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page with a clear message explaining they need to log in first.
4. WHEN an authenticated user clicks the "Dashboard" button THEN the system SHALL direct them to their role-appropriate dashboard (homeowner or homeseeker).
5. WHEN a user has both homeowner and homeseeker roles THEN the system SHALL provide easy navigation between both dashboard types.

### Requirement 2: Dashboard-Centric Property Management

**User Story:** As a property owner, I want a centralized dashboard to manage all my property-related activities, so that I can efficiently list and manage my properties in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a homeowner accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a prominent "List New Property" button.
2. WHEN a homeowner clicks the "List New Property" button THEN the system SHALL check their verification status before proceeding.
3. WHEN a verified homeowner clicks the "List New Property" button THEN the system SHALL direct them to the property listing form.
4. WHEN an unverified homeowner clicks the "List New Property" button THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the owner verification flow.
5. WHEN a homeowner's dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display their existing property listings with management options.
6. WHEN a homeowner's dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show relevant metrics and notifications about their properties.

### Requirement 3: User Role Conversion Flow

**User Story:** As a home seeker, I want to be able to convert my account to a home owner account when I need to list a property, so that I don't need to create a new account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a home seeker accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide an option to "Become a Property Owner".
2. WHEN a home seeker clicks "Become a Property Owner" THEN the system SHALL display information about the responsibilities and benefits of being a property owner.
3. WHEN a user is in the role conversion flow THEN the system SHALL collect additional information necessary for property owners.
4. WHEN a user submits the role conversion form THEN the system SHALL update their account to have dual roles (both home seeker and home owner).
5. WHEN a user completes the role conversion THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the owner verification flow.
6. WHEN a user cancels the role conversion THEN the system SHALL maintain their current role and redirect them back to their home seeker dashboard.

### Requirement 4: Owner Verification Process

**User Story:** As a property owner, I want to verify my identity and ownership status, so that I can list properties and build trust with potential tenants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters the owner verification flow THEN the system SHALL clearly explain the verification requirements and process.
2. WHEN a user is in the verification flow THEN the system SHALL collect identity verification information (ID card, proof of address, etc.).
3. WHEN a user submits verification documents THEN the system SHALL queue them for admin review and set the verification status to "pending".
4. WHEN a user has a pending verification THEN the system SHALL display the verification status and estimated completion time.
5. WHEN an admin approves a user's verification THEN the system SHALL update their status to "verified" and notify the user.
6. WHEN an admin rejects a verification THEN the system SHALL provide feedback to the user about the reason and allow them to resubmit.
7. WHEN a verified owner attempts to list a property THEN the system SHALL allow them to proceed to the property listing form.

### Requirement 5: User Experience and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear guidance and feedback throughout the property listing onboarding process, so that I understand the requirements and next steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is redirected to any step in the onboarding flow THEN the system SHALL clearly explain why they were redirected and what is required.
2. WHEN a user is in the onboarding process THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators showing the current step and remaining steps.
3. WHEN a user completes a step in the process THEN the system SHALL provide clear confirmation and direction to the next step.
4. WHEN a user needs to wait for verification THEN the system SHALL provide alternative actions they can take in the meantime.
5. WHEN a user returns to the platform after partial completion THEN the system SHALL resume the process from where they left off.
6. WHEN a user encounters an error in the process THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options.
