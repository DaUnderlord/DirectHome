# Dashboard Improvements and Map Visualization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for improving the existing dashboard UI/UX and adding a comprehensive map visualization feature to the rent calculator that displays housing market data and property locations using Mapbox integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dashboard UI/UX Improvements

**User Story:** As a user (home seeker or home owner), I want an improved dashboard experience with modern UI design, better data visualization, and enhanced functionality so that I can efficiently manage my property activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a modern, visually appealing interface with improved typography, spacing, and color scheme
2. WHEN a user views dashboard statistics THEN the system SHALL present data using enhanced visual elements including charts, progress bars, and interactive cards
3. WHEN a user interacts with dashboard elements THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and hover effects for better user experience
4. WHEN a user has multiple roles THEN the system SHALL display a prominent role toggle component that allows seamless switching between home seeker and home owner views
5. WHEN a user switches dashboard roles THEN the system SHALL persist their preference and maintain context across sessions
6. WHEN a user views property listings on their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display enhanced property cards with better imagery, status indicators, and action buttons
7. WHEN a user accesses quick actions THEN the system SHALL provide prominent, well-organized action buttons with clear icons and labels
8. WHEN a user views analytics data THEN the system SHALL display interactive charts and graphs instead of placeholder content

### Requirement 2: Map Visualization for Housing Market Data

**User Story:** As a user of the rent calculator, I want to see housing market data visualized on an interactive map so that I can understand price trends, property density, and market conditions in different areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the rent calculator THEN the system SHALL include a new "Market Map" tab alongside existing calculator tabs
2. WHEN a user selects the Market Map tab THEN the system SHALL display an interactive Mapbox map centered on Lagos, Nigeria
3. WHEN the map loads THEN the system SHALL display price heat zones using colored overlays where orange/red indicates high rent areas and blue/green indicates lower rent areas
4. WHEN a user views the map THEN the system SHALL show property markers for all listed properties on the platform with different icons based on property type
5. WHEN a user clicks on a property marker THEN the system SHALL display a popup with property details including price, type, bedrooms, and a link to view full details
6. WHEN a user hovers over price heat zones THEN the system SHALL display tooltip information showing average rent ranges for that area
7. WHEN a user interacts with map controls THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options to show/hide different property types, price ranges, and listing types
8. WHEN a user zooms into specific areas THEN the system SHALL dynamically update heat zones and property markers based on the current view bounds
9. WHEN a user searches for a specific location THEN the system SHALL center the map on that location and highlight relevant market data
10. WHEN a user views market statistics THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with area-specific analytics including average prices, market trends, and property availability

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Property Visualization on Map

**User Story:** As a user viewing the market map, I want to see detailed property information and market insights so that I can make informed decisions about rental prices and property locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN properties are displayed on the map THEN the system SHALL use distinct icons for different property types (house, apartment, condo, etc.)
2. WHEN multiple properties are in close proximity THEN the system SHALL implement clustering to avoid marker overlap while maintaining performance
3. WHEN a user clicks on a property cluster THEN the system SHALL zoom in to reveal individual property markers
4. WHEN a user selects a property marker THEN the system SHALL highlight the property and show detailed information in a side panel
5. WHEN a user views property details THEN the system SHALL display high-quality images, pricing information, key features, and contact options
6. WHEN a user wants to compare properties THEN the system SHALL allow selection of multiple properties for side-by-side comparison
7. WHEN a user views market heat zones THEN the system SHALL calculate and display price data based on actual property listings on the platform
8. WHEN a user filters properties THEN the system SHALL update both the map visualization and heat zones in real-time

### Requirement 4: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new map visualization to work seamlessly with existing platform features so that I have a cohesive experience across all tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the map from the rent calculator THEN the system SHALL maintain context from other calculator tabs (location, property type preferences)
2. WHEN a user finds a property on the map THEN the system SHALL provide direct links to view full property details, contact owners, or schedule viewings
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL allow saving favorite properties directly from the map interface
4. WHEN a user views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL include quick access to the market map feature
5. WHEN property data is updated THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh map visualizations and heat zones
6. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL sync filter states between the map view and other property search interfaces
